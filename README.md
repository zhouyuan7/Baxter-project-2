'position-velocity' control


## Introduction

This is my second Baxter project and my first solo Baxter project. This is also the course project of ME 740 Vision, Robotics and Planning in Boston University. The propose of this project is to estimate a spatial position of a tennis ball and a position-velocity movement strategy generated by myself(partly).

This project can also be classified into a visual servoing control method. Compared with my first baxter project, this is an off-line spatial target position estimation and position-veocity Jacobian control. In detail, this project can also be divided into vision and motion parts.

### Vision

For vision part, the pattern recognition is the same as the first project using color separation method. However, the process of transforming the location information from camera image frame to Baxter coordinate is different. In this project we use both two arms' hand cameras and use linear triangulation and single value decomposition method to estimate the target location in Baxter coordinate system.

The above image is the spatial position estiamtion. The red points are the pattern recognition using color separation and the blue points are the back projecton check bsaed on our estimated spatial coordinate. The result is very good!

### Motion

For motion part, using plain language, now our Baxter opens its 'eyes' and can 'see' something. We want to use its arm to move to it. based on my thought, there are three methods: position-inverse kinematic control, velocity control and 'position-velocity' control.

#### Position-inverse Kinematic Control

Given target work space coordinate. Go through inverse kinematic process to get the relate configurations (joint angles). The core of this method is the inverse kinematic solver. Due to the project time limit, I can not do any better than the default Baxter solver. One of the demo videos shows the perfermance of this method. 

#### Pure Velocity control

With a potential function based on the start point and estimated goal point, using analysis Jacobian matrix, this method does not need to solve inverse kinematic of the robot arm chain only forward kinematic needed. The way I first want to choose but faced an issue which is the gravity of the robot arm (Zero-Gravity mode).


#### Position-velocity control
For this project, I generate a control strategy between the above two levels of control. This control is actually still a position control because the output data still go through the joint angle API not joint velocity, but with a particular trajectory. The following one line algorithm show the strategy.
